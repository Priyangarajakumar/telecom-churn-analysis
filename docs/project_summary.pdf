Telecom Customer Churn - Project Summary

This project analyzes churn behavior in a telecom customer dataset using a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, segmentation, and dashboarding.

Key Insights:
- Churn is highest among month-to-month contract customers.
- Fiber optic users show higher churn due to cost sensitivity.
- Customers without online security or tech support churn more frequently.
- Early-tenure customers (0–12 months) represent the highest-risk cohort.
- Electronic check users and non-autopay customers have significantly higher churn.
- Revenue at Risk and CLV analysis help quantify financial impact.

The final dashboard includes KPI metrics, churn segmentation visuals, billing risk analysis, and strategic retention recommendations.
